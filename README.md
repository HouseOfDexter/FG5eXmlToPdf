# FG5eXmlToPdf
Very early stage proof of concept FantasyGrounds 5e character XML to PDF form converter.

My personal use cases for this are:
1) Be able to give players sheets for premade characters before staring games. 
2) Provide sheets for when using FG as a table top.

Current design idea is Xml -> Character model -> Pdf
That way the model could be reused for other outputs by others in the future.
